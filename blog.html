                    DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It
                    represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM
                    represents the document as nodes and objects. That way, programming languages can connect to the
                    page.

                </h3>
                <p class="ans mt-3">
                    There are two ways to select HTML elements using DOM. One is by using the getElementById() method
                    and the other is by using the querySelector() method. The getElementById() method is used to select
                    an element by its id attribute. The querySelector() method is used to select an element by its
                    CSS selector.

                <p class="ans mt-3">
                    Event bubbling is a way of event propagation in the HTML DOM API, when an event occurs in an
                    element inside another element, and both elements have registered a handle for that event. The
                    event handler is first triggered on the innermost element and then propagated to outer elements.

                <p class="ans mt-3">
                    A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then
                    invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action. Callback functions
                    are used to make sure that a function is “not going to execute until another function has
                    finished executing.”
